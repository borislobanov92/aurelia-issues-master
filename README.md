## Framework choice
The was created with Angular v.4. Angular has very powerful built-in functionality that allows creating a relatively light-weight and smoothly working app.
Also I feel more confident with Angular than with any other JS framework because of my work experience.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.1.

## Project Installation

1. Make sure [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) is installed on your computer:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

2. Clone the project and navigate to the project root directory.

3. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
